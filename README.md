# cardboard-gather is a django-based multi-choice quiz program

At this point (Jan 2019) it is a toy.

Goal is to have an easy-to-add-to resource where you can easily
(without an account) create publicly-available quizzes of multi choice
questions.

Cardboard runs under Django 2.1.4.  Requirements are simple and could
easily be removed:

* social_auth
* decouple
